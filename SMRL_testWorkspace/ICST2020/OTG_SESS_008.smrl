/**
 * An action that (1) is available without logging in and (2) generates a session,
 * should not enable a user to execute an action that requires to be logged in.
 * 
 * This MR iterates over all the actions of the input.
 * 
 * The 1st parameter of the operator IMPLIES is a boolean expression with three clauses joined 
 * with logical conjunction.
 * The 1st clause checks that the current action is not available without being logged in.
 * The 2nd clause looks for an action available without being logged-in that generates a session. 
 * The 3rd clause defines a follow-up input that executes two actions, the action available without being logged in, and
 * the selected action (i.e., the one available only by being logged-in).
 * 
 * The 2nd parameter of IMPLIES checks that the output of the action is different when execute with and without
 * being logged in (even if after an action that does not require a log-in but generates a session).
